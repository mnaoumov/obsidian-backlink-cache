// Keeps the in-repo `demo-vault/` in sync with the plugin's public surface WITHOUT
// Launching Obsidian: it reflects the real config from source and asserts every
// Setting is documented in a note, and that the guard note/member still exist
// (rename drift). Backlink Cache's feature is an extended `getBacklinksForFile`
// API with no dedicated public interface type, so only the PluginSettings config
// Class is reflected; the runtime behavior is covered by the other integration tests.
