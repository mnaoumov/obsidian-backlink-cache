# Backlink Cache

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that maintains backlink cache to speed up undocumented `app.metadataCache.getBacklinksForFile` function.

It's mostly useful for users with the large vaults. On smaller vaults the difference might be unnoticeable.

It speeds up `Backlinks Pane` performance and plugins that deal with the backlinks.

This plugin the most likely will be useful for other plugin developers that deal with the backlinks.

Its idea came from the [forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/store-backlinks-in-metadatacache/67000).

If you need to call the original version, you can use `app.metadataCache.getBacklinksForFile.originalFunc` function.

## Installation

- `Backlink Cache` is available in [the official Community Plugins repository](https://obsidian.md/plugins).
